    # DataFrames
    Author: [*Raine Hoang*](https://github.com/Jystine)

    In this tutorial, we will go over the central data structure for structured data, DataFrames. There are a multitude of packages that work with DataFrames, but we will be focusing on the way Polars uses them the different options it provides.

    ## Summary

    DataFrames are a useful data structure that can be used to organize and perform additional analysis on your data. In this notebook, we have learned how to define DataFrames, what can be a DataFrame, the structure of it, and additional parameters you can set while creating it. 

    In order to create a DataFrame, you pass your data into the .DataFrame() method through the data parameter. The data you pass through must be either a dictionary, sequence, array, series, or pandas DataFrame. Once defined, the DataFrame will separate the data into different columns and the data within the column must have the same data type. There exists additional parameters besides data that allows you to further customize the ending DataFrame. Some examples of these are orient, strict, and infer_schema_length.
